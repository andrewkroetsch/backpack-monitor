# backpack-monitor
This program will cause an LED to change colors if a backpack worn by the user is too heavy, or if their posture is off.
This program utilizes two FSR sensors mounted to the shoulders of a shirt, as well as a flex sensor located on the spine
near the neck.

This program was created for Kate Hartman's Wearable Computing class at OCADU, please feel free to use it and change it as you
see fit.
